Install
=======

It's higly recommended to use a virual-env utility for example:
`virtualenvwrapper <https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
before doing anything.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install adia

Or, install the latest version from the source:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install git+https://github.com/pylover/adia
